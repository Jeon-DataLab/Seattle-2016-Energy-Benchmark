# Seattle-2016-Energy-Benchmark
Seattle Building Energy Benchmarking and Reporting Program requires owners of non-residential and multifamily buildings to track energy performance annually report to the city of Seattle: https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy. The project creates R Shiny and Tableau to look at Greenhouse consumption in the Greater Seattle Area. Two R files are uploaded to the repository. Each will include an interactive R dashboard that feeds Seattle benchmarking dataset as a basis.
